**Flight Search**

With an increasing number of airlines in the skies (and those cheap flights from the COVID-19 pandemic 😉) users now have more options than ever for how to get from point A to point B. Arguably, the most important interaction for airlines to focus on is the “book a flight” experience.

Design a part of the experience, for mobile or web, where users can search for flights.
