**Design an App Icon.**

An app icon is a unique image added for every mobile application, and the first users see when they find an app on the Apple App Store and Google Play.

Things to consider:
- **Scalability:** There’s no flexibility in icon size—they come in tiny and tinier, and can’t be stretched or changed. That means that legibility is first priority for app icons. You’ll notice that icons don’t only appear on the home page, they also appear in sub-menus with an even more reduced size.
- **Recognizability:** To make sure your icon stands out, spend some time checking out apps in your niche. If most of the icons you see are colorful, consider using a monochrome palette. If there are a lot of images of one particular item, show something different.
- **Consistency:** An icon is part of an application, and the branding has to stay consistent between the two. An icon should describe an app and show its main features.
- **Compliance:** Despite the fact that iOS and Android icons are starting to look the same, there are still a lot of differences that prevent us from using the same app icon on both operating systems: proportions, visual techniques, and special features. Users get used to their operating systems.
