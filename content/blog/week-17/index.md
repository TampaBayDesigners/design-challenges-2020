**Music Player**

Many of us listen to music through one of many cross-platform apps - Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, etc.

This week's challenge is to design a music player. What should we think about when designing a music player?

- Online and offline music streaming
- Playlists
- Random music flow
- Sound equalization

What about profile screens, home screens, etc.

Design a music player for web, mobile, car, whatever really - have fun!
