**Sign Up Landing Page**

This ones a bit meta - create a landing page for people to sign up for the **Tampa Bay Designers** Slack workspace. What value props can we show for people to join? Which elements on the page should be most prominent? You get to decide, and have fun!

... we might even build it and share it soon so people can use it to sign up ðŸ˜‰.
