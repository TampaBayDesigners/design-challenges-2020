**Shopping Cart**

The shopping cart is obviously an important page for many ecommerce sites where users order multiple items. It often determines whether or not users will progress to the all-important checkout â€” not giving the user what they need here can cause them to abandon their purchase.

How can we make a better, more beautiful experience for a shopping cart?

- Can users change the quantity of items?
- How do we layout information?
- How do we show shipping?
- Can users add a discount?

Design a shopping cart page - have fun!
