**Onboarding**

User onboarding is a designed series of interactions and/instructions that help the user ease into the productâ€™s experience. It can be as simple as a greeting and an explanation or as complex as a series of guided tasks for users to complete. So long as youâ€™re providing your users with an on-ramp to the benefits of your product, youâ€™re setting them up for success.

- Slide onboarding using a few static screens
- Tooltip onboarding
- Guided task onboarding

Design an onboarding experience for any app you'd like - have fun!
