**Ecommerce Item**

In ecommerce, product pages are critical to the success of a site. Customers need to have enough information to make an informed purchase decision. The product page, or product-detail page, is where users decide whether and what to buy. The page must include complete product information, educating and informing the user about the product in a straightforward way.

Product pages are where shoppers go to determine whether a product suits their needs. To be successful, ecommerce sites must first conduct research to determine the kinds of questions customers have about their products. Designers should use descriptions and images to answer user questions, help them compare products, and enable people to begin the purchase process as quickly and easily as possible.
