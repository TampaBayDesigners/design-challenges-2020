**Design an On/Off switch.**

Toggle switches are digital on/off switches. They prompt users to choose between two mutually exclusive options and always have a default value. Toggles should provide immediate results, giving users the freedom to control their preferences as needed.

Things to consider:
- Should the switch have state descriptors?
- Which colors, if at all, should depict the state of the swtich?
- How should the switch describe what is being toggled?
