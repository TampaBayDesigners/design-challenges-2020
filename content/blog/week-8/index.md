**Design a Leaderboard.**

A leader board, containing a list of rankings representing performance in a particular category or overall standings, helps to show users exactly how they are performing in relation to others.

Things to consider:
- Making clear to users how they are performing compared to other competitors is vital
- Show users the top performers
- Filters can also improve the user experience
