**User Profile**

Creating user profiles on a website or app is a great way to keep your audience engaged. People come, sign in, fill in the info about themselves, and engage with your product. Many user profiles are optimized to promote things they are able to do in the app, whether it be connecting with others, voting, adding a CV, etc.

Design a user profile - however you'd like!
