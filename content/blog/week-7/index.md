**Design Logo/Business Card for a Photographer.**

Could the card be a rectangle? Sure. But what about an awesome die-cut shape with foil ink that glows-in-the-dark?

> Name:
> **Tyler Smith Photography**

> Background:
> 
> I'm primarily a landscape/cityscape photographer but my business will mostly be photographing homes for real estate listings. I may have some future interest in branching out into other event or portrait photography.
> 
> I envision something simple, not overly cluttered. I like black & white with a little color sprinkled in. One of my initial thoughts was a predominantly black and white with a little red, green, blue, yellow that are reflected on a camera's histogram. That's the only idea I had but I'm not married to it.
