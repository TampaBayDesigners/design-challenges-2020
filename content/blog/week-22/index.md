**Itinerary**

Whether we're attending weddings, travelling, or at work, we experience glancing through an itinerary for a specific event. As designers, we typically see how areas of designed itineraries can be better through:

- Color palette
- Typography
- Layout

Design a print or digital itinerary for an event - have fun!
