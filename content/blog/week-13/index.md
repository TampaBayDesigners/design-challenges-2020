**Icon Set**

Icons are an essential part of design, visually expressing objects, actions and ideas. When done correctly, they communicate the core idea and intent of a product or action, and they bring a lot of nice benefits to user interfaces, such as saving screen real estate and enhancing aesthetic appeal. Last but not least, most apps and websites have icons. Itâ€™s a design pattern that is familiar to users.

Despite these advantages, icons can cause usability problems when designers hide functionality behind icons that are hard to recognize. An iconâ€™s first job is to guide users to where they need to go.

Things to consider:
- Easy to recognize: Try to use icons that are familiar to your users, test scalability
- Visually pleasing: Reduce the amount of graphic details, create delight by adding an animation effect
- Consistent: Icon sets should have visual unification

Design a set of icons for an interface, print design, or whatever design you'd like - have fun!
