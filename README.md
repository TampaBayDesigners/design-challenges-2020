# Design Challenges 2020
### Tampa Bay Designers

**Background**

While the Daily UI challenges are great for leveling up some visual/interaction design skills, it could be tedious to work through while balancing work, life, etc. So, we decided to break design challenges up into weekly segments.

Use these challenges to set goals, learn something new, flex some muscles that haven't been used, help beginners get a behind the scenes view of design, or just do them because it may be fun.

### Rules
- Doesn’t have to be an interactive prototype, but could be cool, even if it’s basic.
- Spice it up every now and then, use animation to show off some sick little IxD.
- Make it weird, make it pretty, make it useful, make it however you'd like
- SHARE your work, even if it's not pretty, or functional, or...
